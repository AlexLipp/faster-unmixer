# Unmixing nested observed concentrations in river networks for source regions

This repository implements an efficient solution to the unmixing of nested concentrations in a (river) network using convex optimisation. The method is described in our [EGU abstract](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-5368.html) 

## Data input assumptions

The algorithm requires:

1) A GDAL readable raster of D8 flow directions. We use the ESRI/Arc D8 convention of representing directions with increasing powers of 2 (i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8 etc.) with sink pixels indicated by 0. We assume that every cell in the domain eventually flows into a sink node within the domain (or is itself a sink node). This assumption requires that **every boundary pixel is set to be a sink**.

2) A tab-delimited file which contains the names, locations and geochemical observations at the sample sites. Sample names are given in column `Sample.Code`, and the x and y-coordinates of the sample sites in columns `x_coordinate` and `y_coordinate`. The x and y-coordinates of the sample sites need to be in the same reference system as the D8 raster. It is assumed that the sample sites have already been manually aligned onto the drainage network.  Subsequent columns contain the name of a given tracer (e.g., `Mg`) and their concentrations (arbitrary units).

Example datasets are given in `data/d8.asc` and `sample_data.dat`.


## Compiling 

The following assumes a UNIX operating systems. If running Windows OS you will need to install a [Linux subsystem](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). 

Check out submodules:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install prereqs:
```
sudo apt install pybind11-dev cmake
```

Compile the C++ code:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DUSE_GDAL=ON ..
make
cd ..
```

A conda environment file (`requirements.yaml`) is provided containing the python dependencies. A conda environment entitled `unmixing` can be generated from it using `conda env create -f requirements.yaml`.    

### Testing compilation

To test if installation has happened correctly run the unit test:
```
python3 synthetic_test.py
```

This script aims to recover a randomly generated synthetic upstream dataset. If installed correctly this should print `SUCCESS: All tests passed!` to console. If it returns: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyfastunmix'`, you may need to add the `build/` directory to your path using: 
```
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:build/
```
or by adding: 
```
import sys
sys.path.append('build')
``` 
to the header of any `python` scripts.

## Usage

Two example scripts are given which are minimum working examples of unmixing a network of samples (solving discretely for each sub-basin and continuously over a grid), using the example datasets described above:
```
python3 unmix_mwe.py
python3 unmix_continuous_mwe.py
```
